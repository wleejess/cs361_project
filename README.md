A repository for my CS361 course at Oregon State University

Project Name: Style.TBD
Description: A web-app designed to help users keep track of their clothes and build a sustainable, versatile, and timeless wardrobe. 

This project has (2x) objectives: 
1. Assist people in their day-to-day lives by keeping track of what clothes they own and allow them to quickly visualize different combinations for outfits.
2. Reduce their impact on the environment (aka fast fashion) through mindfulness and intention.

Overview
- Add **categories** to organize their wardrobe
- Add, archive, modify **clothes** within their wardrobe (Follow-Up: Include metadata about cost/quality/brand/weather/occasion)
- Browse closet, filter by metadata

Project Plan: Currently using Notion and Asana to manage the project plan. Will include links to each page in a future update.
